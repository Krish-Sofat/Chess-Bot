Chess AI Engine (Human vs. CPU)
A high-performance Chess application featuring a custom AI engine built with Python, Pygame, and python-chess. This project demonstrates the implementation of classical game theory and search optimizations to create a challenging strategic opponent.

🧠 Technical Highlights
Minimax Algorithm: Simulates future board states to determine optimal moves.
Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optimized the search tree by eliminating sub-optimal branches, increasing search depth and speed.
Heuristic Evaluation: Uses Piece-Square Tables (PSTs) for advanced positional awareness and material weighting.
Interactive GUI: Features square highlighting, move validation, and automated pawn promotion.
